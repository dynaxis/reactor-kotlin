# Kotlin extensions for Reactor

This library exposes a set of [extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)
that allow a more idiomatic Kotlin usage or [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) APIs.

See our [unit tests](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-kotlin/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/reactor/core/publisher) for code examples.

It is inspired from [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin).
