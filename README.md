# Kotlin extensions for Reactor

This library exposes a set of [extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)
that allow a more idiomatic Kotlin usage or [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) APIs.

## Usage

See our [unit tests](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-kotlin/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/reactor/core/publisher) for code examples.

To use it in your project:

- Repository: `https://repo.spring.io/snapshot`
- Artifact: `io.projectreactor:reactor-kotlin:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`

It is inspired from [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin).
